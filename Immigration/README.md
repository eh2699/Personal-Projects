### 1980 - 2016 Q1Q2 Immigration by Country of Origin
An exploratory data analysis of a historical dataset detailing the breakdown of immigrants to Canada by country of origin. The data was obtained from [Open Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ad975a26-df23-456a-8ada-756191a23695). The data is also available as a CSV format in this folder under `byCountry_1980_2016Q2.csv`. The analysis has been stored in the `IRCC_1980_2016Q1Q2_byCountry.ipynb` notebook, also viewable here. 

In addition to cleaning and conducting initial explorations, the analysis sought to:
- Determine the highest and the lowest recorded number of immigrants to Canada for a single year
- Determine the breakdown by country of origin for the highest and lowest recorded years
- Graphically represent the number of immigrants Canada received during 1980-2016
- Determine the top 10 cumulative immigrant contributing countries, and graphically represent the number of immigrants from these countries during 1980-2016
- Examine data from 2015 and 2016 Q1Q2 and identify discrepancies
